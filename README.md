<img src="./Screenshot 2022-04-23 230550.png" />


## DESCRIPTION
This App contains information about the Tabletop Game Pathfinder 2. It is currently focused only on character ancestries


## Features/Learning Purposes
This project demonstrates the use of React and Axiom in fetching data from the web and specifically uses https://api.pathfinder2.fr


## HOW TO USE
Click on an ancestry button to display detailed information.
To install this app on your own, An API Authentication key must be obtained from https://api.pathfinder2.fr and it needs to be added into the header of the get request.
The data retrieved from the API is then manipulated to be displayed in the app function


## ROADMAP of FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
As the app is now, it has functionality to see all available character ancestries and expand each with a button to show more detailed information. Adding in the ability to view other aspects of the game would be nice as they are available through the API. It is only a matter of time investment to add another layer above the ancestry focus and allow the fetch call to change the url for the specific section of data it is pulling.
